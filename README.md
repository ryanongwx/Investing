# Investing

This repository is for the programs that I have written which are related to investing and stocks. As investing is one field that I am interested
in, I will attempt to write programs from time to time that may help me in the process of investing. The possible areas that these programs can
enable to be more efficient are areas such as calculation and information retrieving from the web. Through the application of the investing
principles that I have picked up when reading books, I will apply them and make us of code to make calculations easier. This will definitely aid
me in finding the 'right' stocks to invest in.
